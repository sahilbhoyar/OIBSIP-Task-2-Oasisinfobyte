            <br>Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire in western India. 
            He is considered to be one of the greatest warriors of his time and even today, stories 
            of his exploits are narrated as a part of the folklore. With his valor and great administrative 
            skills, Shivaji carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur. 
            It eventually became the genesis of the Maratha Empire. After establishing his rule, Shivaji 
            implemented a competent and progressive administration with the help of a disciplined military 
            and well-established administrative set-up. Shivaji is well-known for his innovative military 
            tactics that centered around non-conventional methods leveraging strategic factors like geography, 
            speed, and surprise to defeat his more powerful enemies.

            <br>Shivaji Bhosle was born on February 19, 1630 to Shahaji Bhosle and Jijabai in the fort of Shivneri, 
            near the city of Junnar of the Pune district. Shivaji’s father Shahaji was in service of the Bijapuri 
            Sultanate - a tripartite association between Bijapur, Ahmednagar, and Golconda, as a general. 
            He also owned a Jaigirdari near Pune. Shivaji’s mother Jijabai was the daughter of Sindkhed leader 
            Lakhujirao Jadhav and a deeply religious woman. Shivaji was especially close to his mother who 
            instilled in him a strict sense of right and wrong. Since Shahaji spent most of his time outside 
            of Pune, the responsibility of overseeing Shivaji’s education rested on the shoulders of a small 
            council of ministers which included a Peshwa (Shamrao Nilkanth),a Mazumdar (Balkrishna Pant), 
            a Sabnis (Raghunath Ballal), a Dabir (Sonopant) and a chief teacher (Dadoji Konddeo). Kanhoji 
            Jedhe and Baji Pasalkar were appointed to train Shivaji in military and martial arts. Shivaji 
            was married to Saibai Nimbalkar in 1640.
