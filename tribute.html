          <h2>Greatest King in World</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire 
                in western India. He is considered to be one of the greatest 
                warriors of his time and even today, stories of his exploits are 
                narrated as a part of the folklore. With his valor and great 
                administrative skills, Shivaji carved out an enclave from the 
                declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur. It eventually became 
                the genesis of the Maratha Empire. After establishing his rule, 
                Shivaji implemented a competent and progressive administration 
                with the help of a disciplined military and well-established 
                administrative set-up. Shivaji is well-known for his innovative
                 military tactics that centered around non-conventional methods 
                 leveraging strategic factors like geography, speed, and surprise 
                 to defeat his more powerful enemies.
